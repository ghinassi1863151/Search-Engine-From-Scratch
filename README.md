## Goal
The Goal of this notebook is to build our own search engine from scratch by using techniques such as text pre-processing, reverse indexing and cosine similarity.

## Overwiev

1. Crawling and parsing html's to build the set of documents
2. Text pre-processing of the documents
3. Reverse indexing 
4. Computation of the inverse term frequency and inverse document frequency (Tf-idf)
5. Implementation of the Search Engine with the cosine similarity

## Content

- __SearchEngine.ipynb__ is the main notebook 
- __functions.py__ contains all the functions to crawl, parse, pre-process and compute the queries
- __data__ is a folder of _.pickle_ files that are the already processed data necessary to run the notebook
